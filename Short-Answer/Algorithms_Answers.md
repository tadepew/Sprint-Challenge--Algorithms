#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) linear, while loops runs n times.

b) O(n log n) the inner while loop j is increasing exponentially and the outer for loop runs n times

c) O(log n) the recursive call is directly proportional to the n

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search tree (O(log n)) to reduce possibilites by half each time until it is at floor f in which it doesn't break on that floor. It would go left(lower floor) if the egg breaks at that midpoint and go right if the egg doesn't break. When it is at the end the egg will not break at floor f but will break at the floor below.
